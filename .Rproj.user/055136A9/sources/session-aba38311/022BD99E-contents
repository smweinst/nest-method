#### 
##### Hello! I'm an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://cph.temple.edu/departments-research/departments/department-epidemiology-and-biostatistics) at [Temple University College of Public Health](https://cph.temple.edu/).

I mainly work on developing new statistical methods for analyzing neuroimaging data, motivated by applications in mental health, neurodevelopment, and neurodegenerative disease. I'm also involved in research across numerous areas as a statistical collaborator.

Before joining the faculty at Temple, I was a PhD student at Penn, where I was a member of the Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Center ([PennSIVE](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/pennsive)). I was also previously a data analyst at the [Hospital for Special Surgery](https://www.hss.edu/) and an undergrad at [Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu/).
